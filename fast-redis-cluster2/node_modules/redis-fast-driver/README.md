Redis-fast-driver
===

Trully async redis driver. Extremly simple, extremely fast.

This node module use hiredis async library written on C by Salvatore Sanfilippo.

All regular functions including PUB/SUB and MONITOR mode works fine, this driver almost an year on my production enviroment under really have load (30k ops/sec each redis in cluster)...
Also this driver used in https://github.com/joaojeronimo/node_redis_cluster and in my fork https://github.com/h0x91b/fast-redis-cluster

Usage
===

Look at `example*.js` for usage.

Speed
===

Works MUCH faster then node-redis and even faster then `redis-benchmark` tool.

Results for my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) via tcp/ip.

My driver:
